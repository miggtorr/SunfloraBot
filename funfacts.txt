Despite its English name, Bulbasaur's design is based on a frog, not a dinosaur!
Due to the censorship that prevents Pok√©mon with offensive nicknames being traded on the GTS, an Ivysaur (or any of its evolutionary line) with an English name couldn't be traded on the GTS without a nickname in Pok√©mon Black and White. This is because, the word 'Sau' in German means 'female pig,' a word commonly used as an insult!
Venusaur and its evolutionary relatives share their category with Sunkern! They are all known as the Seed Pok√©mon!
Charmander's eyes are blue (teal)!
In episode 429 of the anime, Elina's Charmeleon goes on a date with a wild Wartortle, wherein the Charmeleon uses Water Gun to impress the Wartortle!
Prior to Generation VI, Charizard and Rhyhorn shared the same cry! (Example: https://youtu.be/BiHxE6bZQb4)
While Squirtle typically walks on its two short legs, it has been shown to run on all fours in Super Smash Bros. Brawl!
Wartortle's feathery tail may be a reference to Japanese legends of the minogame (Ëìë‰∫Ä), a turtle which lived for 10,000 years and grew a tail made of seaweed!
Despite being based neither on a crustacean nor a marine mollusk, Blastoise is known as the Shellfish Pok√©mon! 
The antenna on Caterpie's head canonically STINKS!
In the almost every Pok√©mon game, the TCG, and promotional artwork, Metapod's eyes are white. In the anime, however, they are yellow, and in Colliseum and XD they are blue!
In Generation IV only, Butterfree can learn a Dragon-type move: Twister, via Move Tutor!
Weedle is the only Pok√©mon that cannot legitimately know any Normal-type move!
Kakuna has arms! Seen only in its Red and Blue sprite and on a rare Sugimori-drawn 'Pocket Monsters' Bandai card, its arms are commonly mistaken to be a sprite error or simply thought not to exist! https://bulbapedia.bulbagarden.net/wiki/File:Bandai_Kakuna_card.jpg 
According to all known laws of aviation, there is no way a Beedrill should be able to fly. It's wings are too small to get its fat little body off the ground. The Beedrill, of course, flies anyway, because Beedrill don't care what humans think is impossible.
In the anime, Pidgey is often erroneously depicted with four talons on each foot, as opposed to three!
In some games, the Pok√©dex states that Pidgeotto 'will fiercely peck at any intruder.' However, Pidgeotto is unable to learn Peck!
Pidgeot has a mullet! Business in the front, party in the back, baby! üòé
In the Pok√©mon Red and Blue beta, Rattata was originally known as Rattatak!
Raticate is the only Pok√©mon that shares its National Pok√©dex number, 20, with the level at which it evolves from its pre-evolved form!
Spearow preys on various forms of Bug-type pok√©mon, as well as Sunkern! Wait‚Äî üò≥ SUNKERN!? That's not fun. üò† WHO WROTE THESE!? @miggtorr!???!??
Fearow is able to fly using its massive wings and attack using its sharp beak. This is because it has massive wings that are large and a sharp beak that is really pointy! Through the use of these unique anatomical features, namely its large wings and pointed beak, it is able to fly and hunt for pray. Also its shiny is blue in Pok√©mon Stadium 2.
In early official art of Ekans, namely the Sugimori watercolors, all of the bands on its body were colored yellow instead of just the one on its neck. This was changed in later depictions of Ekans.
In its Gen I sprite, Arbok had markings on the back of its head in addition to those on the front.
Pikachu originally had a second-stage evolution, after Raichu, named Gorochu which would have had two horns and fangs. Ken Sugimori stated that while there was nothing wrong with its appearance, it was nonetheless omitted from Pok√©mon Red and Green, as the staff found that the game was more balanced without it. Moreover, some Pok√©mon originally designed to evolve twice were changed to evolve only once due to limited game space.
In Pok√©mon Red and Blue, there is a Scientist at the Pok√©mon Lab in Cinnabar Island who will trade you an Electrode for a Raichu. If the player talks to him after the trade, he will mention that the Raichu evolved! This is due to a translation error (in Japanese Blue versions he trades a Graveler for a Kadabra).
The pattern on Sandshrew's hide makes it look like it's made of sandstone bricks! This pattern was absent from Sandshrew's initial design, so its Red, Blue, and Green sprites look much more scaley.
In the Pok√©mon Red and Blue beta, Sandslash's original name was "Sandstorm".
Nidoran‚ôÄ is the only Pok√©mon that loses the ability to breed upon evolution. Neither Nidorina nor Nidoqueen can produce eggs!
In Gen I only, Nidorina can learn Bubblebeam!
In a 1996 Japanese publication by Creatures, Inc. titled 'Pocket Monsters Encyclopedia,' Nidoqueen and Nidorina's inability to lay Eggs was established before breeding became a mechanic in the games!
When traded into a Gen II game from a Gen I game, a Nidoran‚ôÇ will always arrive holding a TM43 (Detect)!
Unlike Nidorina and Nidoqueen, Nidorino is capable of producing eggs, belonging to both the Monster and Field egg groups.
Nidoking isn't actually a real 'King' of any country or nation-state, fictional or otherwise. The 'king' in its name is actually an abbreviated form of 'Burger King!' ...wait‚Äîwhat?? Who wrote this!? @miggtorr!!?? üò†
While Pikachu may nowadays be the worldwide mascot of the Pok√©mon franchise, Clefairy was an early contender for the position during the franchise's infancy.
In the Pok√©mon Red and Green beta, Clefable's name was Ariala. This sounds very close to the word 'areola,' the clinical term for nipple, so it's a good thing they changed it! (Incidentally, this linguistic phenomenon didn't stop them from naming Magmar 'Boober' in Japan).
Vulpix is born with only a single, white tail that splits into six as Vulpix grows!
Ninetales is actually Naruto.
Due to an oversight, Jigglypuff appears purple (instead of pink) in the battle against Gengar in the intro of Pok√©mon Blue (including the Japanese version)! 
In its earlier appearances (Gens I-II), Wigglytuff's white stomach did not always extend above its mouth as it does in modern rendition of this Pok√©mon!
Since Zubat is eyeless, in Pok√©mon Legends: Arceus, Alpha Zubats don't include glowing red eyes!
The only core series games to depict Golbat's tongue were Pok√©mon Red and Blue!
Oddish's name may be derived from the words 'odd' and 'radish!'
Gloom is the only dual-type Pok√©mon that can evolve into a single-type Pok√©mon‚ÄîBellossom)!
Although Vileplume has the Chlorophyll Ability, the Rafflesia family of plants that it is based on do not contain chlorophyll!

When Parasect evolves from Paras, the tochukaso mushroom on its back takes complete control of the host and does all the thinking!
In Pok√©mon Crystal only, Venonat's eyes flash during its sprite animation!
In early official art, Venomoth had yellow spots on the back of its wings! These spots were removed when later official artwork was released.
In Pok√©mon Mystery Dungeon: Red Rescue Team and Blue Rescue Team, a Diglett you encounter mentions having feet!
Dugtrio has the highest base Speed stat of all Ground-type Pok√©mon, but of all Pok√©mon to have the highest Speed stat of their respective types, Dugtrio is the slowest!
The only time Meowth is depicted on all fours in the games is in Pok√©mon HGSS: when the player places Meowth as the first Pok√©mon in their party, Meowth will walk on four legs behind the player!
In German, Persian's name is 'Snobilikat,' from the words 'snob,' 'nobilis,' (Latin for noble) and 'Katze' (cat)!
Junichi Masuda revealed that Psyduck was considered for the role of Pikachu's counterpart in Pok√©mon: Let's Go, Pikachu! and Let's Go, Eevee! instead of Eevee, but it was ultimately not chosen due to it being deemed too similar in color to Pikachu!
Although Golduck possesses psychic abilities, it is only a pure Water-type!
Mankey's name, 'Mankey,' comes from the English word 'monkey'! This is because it resembles a monkey!
A Primape caught in Gen I will be holding the Gold Leaf item when traded to a Gen II game! This rare item seemingly has no use; it can only be sold for a paltry ‚ÇΩ1000.
Growlithe's forepaws have two visible claws, while its hind paws have three toes each!
Arcanine's Japanese name is „Ç¶„Ç§„É≥„Éá„Ç£ (Windy). This is a reference to the Pok√©mon's notorious flatulence! üçë üí®
Prior to Gen VI, Poliwag and Ditto had the same cry! (Compare Polywag: https://youtu.be/UzNT7nT62AE, Ditto: https://youtu.be/Hmd_9hKTKsM)
In Pok√©mon Red, Green, Blue, Gold, Silver, Crystal, Ruby, & Sapphire, Poliwhirl is depicted with fingers on his hands! In Pok√©mon Yellow, as well as every main-series game from Emerald onward, however, his hands look like mittens!
In some illustrations, notably its Gen II sprites, Poliwrath is depicted with four fingers instead of three!
In Gen I only, Abra can learn the move Skull Bash.
The symbols on Kadabra's forehead and abdomen appear to be references to 'Zener cards,' a small deck of symbols used in experiments to test for ESP and clairvoyance in the early 1930s!
Alakazam and its pre-evolved form, Kadabra, are the only known Pok√©mon capable of learning the move Kinesis! While this move drops the target's Accuracy by 1 stage, it only has an 80% chance to hit, making it one of the worst moves in the entire franchise!
Before the release of the English versions of Pok√©mon Red and Blue, Machop was known as 'Kara-Tee.' Sounds kinda racist tbh, but what to I know? I'm just a robotic sunflower. ü§ñ BEEP BOOB BOPP ü§ñ
Machoke has been featured on 20 different cards since it debuted in the Base Set of the Pok√©mon Trading Card Game!
When Machamp evolves from Machoke it gains ten fingers, but loses six toes!
In Episode 600 of the anime, a wild Bellsprout is seen using the move Absorb, but Bellsprout cannot learn Absorb in any main series game!
Weepinbell's Gold and Silver sprites are almost identical, with its left leaf pointing up in Gold and down in Silver. Its mouth is also slightly rotated. Incidentally, Pok√©mon Crystal uses the Gold sprite as the basis for its sprite and subsequent animation.
The blue lips in Victreebel's shiny coloration may reference how the rims of certain pitcher plants glow blue under UV light!
In Pok√©mon XD: Gale of Darkness, Tentacool's shiny has blue jewels, green tentacles, and light blue eyes!
In the Pok√©mon Red and Blue beta, Tentacruel was originally known as Manowar, after the deadly 'Portuguese Man o‚Äô War' jellyfish!

In the Pok√©mon Gold and Silver Spaceworld '97 demo, Farfetch'd had an evolution, known as „Éû„ÉÄ„Éº„É† (MadƒÅmu), that was scrapped in the final release of the games! Sirfetch'd was not based on this scrapped evolution.

Alolan Grimer's rainbow colors are based on a phenomenon called 'thin-film interference,' wherein a spectrum of colors is reflected from a thin layer of oil floating on top of water!
Grimer's name in French is Tadmorv, which comes from the phrase 'tas de morve,' meaning 'pile of snot'!
Muk pronounced backwards is‚Äî hey wait a sec, who wrote this!? üò† @miggtorr?!?
Muk's name in French is Grotadmorv, a contraction of 'gros Tadmorv,' meaning 'Big Grimer,' or‚Äîmore literally‚Äî'big pile of snot'!
Shellder swims backward by opening and closing its two shells!
In Pok√©mon Red and Blue only, Cloyster's shell depicted opening vertically‚Äîlike a traditional clam‚Äîin its front sprite!
Pok√©mon Yellow was the first game in which Gastly's face was depicted with a well-defined edge!

Voltorb has the lowest base Attack stat of all Electric-type Pok√©mon: 30!
In episode 113 of the anime, the 'Who's that Pok√©mon?' silhouette featured a black circle with two antennae-like filaments arcing out. The circle was an Electrode bearing a surprised expression and the filaments were actually its eyebrows raised in shock! (https://youtu.be/cDqtX-o2L8M)
Exeggcute's shiny was originally greenish-yellow! It was changed to be golden in Gen III!
Exeggutor is a rare example of a Pok√©mon that is capable of de-evolution because when one of its heads grows too big, it falls off, becoming an Exeggcute in the process!

Hitmonchan and Hitmonlee are the only Pok√©mon that were introduced as not being evolutionary relatives but later became part of the same evolutionary family!
