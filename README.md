## ![Sunflora](https://archives.bulbagarden.net/media/upload/b/b0/Trozeiani192.png) Installation ![Sunflora](https://archives.bulbagarden.net/media/upload/b/b0/Trozeiani192.png) 

### ![SunfloraSmall](https://archives.bulbagarden.net/media/upload/e/e3/Ani192MS.png)Install node.js on your machine

Node.js is just Javascript that runs as standalone ‚Äúserverside‚Äù software‚Äîas opposed to Javascript that runs ‚Äúclientside‚Äù (e.g., on a webpage in your browser). Installing node.js will allow your computer to run SunfloraBot, which is written in Javascript.

1. Go to https://nodejs.org/en and download the installer for the most recent "LTS" version (LTS stands for ‚Äúlong term support‚Äù and will be the most stable version).

2. Run the installer.

### ![SunfloraSmall](https://archives.bulbagarden.net/media/upload/e/e3/Ani192MS.png)Install SunfloraBot

1. Download the SunfloraBot directory and store it locally in an arbitrary location. That's it!

### ![SunfloraSmall](https://archives.bulbagarden.net/media/upload/e/e3/Ani192MS.png)Connecting SunfloraBot to a Twitch account

#### ![Sunkern](https://archives.bulbagarden.net/media/upload/b/b1/Ani191OD.png)Getting login credentials that the bot can use.

1. You can use your own Twitch account for this or you can make a new one. 
2. Log into the Twitch account from whoch you'd like SunfloraBot to post.
3. Go to https://twitchapps.com/tmi/ and press **Connect** and then click **Authorize**.
4. Copy the entire OAuth password that is given to you and save it somewhere safe. Don't share this with anyone.

#### ![Sunkern](https://archives.bulbagarden.net/media/upload/b/b1/Ani191OD.png)Providing the credentials to the bot itself.

1. In the SunfloraBot directory, create a new file (either using an IDE like **Visual Studio Code** or a simple text editor like **TextEdit** or **Notepad**. If using **TextEdit** or **Notepad**, be sure you're writing plain text, not rich text).
2. Open the file and paste the following code, substituting your own data for the fields as shown: 
```
{
    "channel" : "[channel to post in]",
    "username" : "[username of the account the bot will post as]",
    "password" : "[the complete OAuth password you got from before, including the 'oauth:' part at the beginning]"
}
```
For example:
```
{
    "channel" : "pokimane",
    "username" : "SunfloraBot",
    "password" : "oauth:1z08sdaf94fs430f918ur01hj93y0"
}
```
3. Save that file as a JSON file in the SunfloraBot directory. This means it needs to be plaintext and you need to use the .json extension, not .txt.

## ![Sunflora](https://archives.bulbagarden.net/media/upload/b/b0/Trozeiani192.png) Activating SunfloraBot ![Sunflora](https://archives.bulbagarden.net/media/upload/b/b0/Trozeiani192.png) 

2. Open the **Terminal** or **Command Line** and navigate to the SunfloraBot folder by typing `cd [path]/SunfloraBot/`.

3. In the **Terminal** or **Command Line**, activate SunfloraBot by typing `node index.js`

4. You should then see SunfloraBot join the chat of the channel specified above.

5. To deactivate SunfloraBot, you can either press `CTRL+C` in the **Terminal** or a mod can type `!disconnect` in the chat where SunfloraBot has joined. 

![note](https://archives.bulbagarden.net/media/upload/e/e3/Ani192MS.png) **NOTE**: Using the `!disconnect` command will saves all the shiny rolls and updated Orre names before it deactivates. `CTRL+C` in the terminal will prompt the user whether they want to save shiny rolls and Orre names. `!save` can also be used in the terminal to manually save shiny rolls and Orre names without notifying chat.

6. SunfloraBot should be deactivated **after every stream** so it can save the shiny rolls and so it won't crash if the computer on which it's running goes to sleep.
